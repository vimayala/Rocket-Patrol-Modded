Modifications:
[x] Create a new enemy Spaceship type (w/ new artwork) that's smaller, moves faster, and is worth more points (5)
    - new enemy (Mini) moves at a faster speed that speed up per hit so players can't time their hits, then reverts to a slower speed once the max is hit
    - it also uses another explosion animation and a sped up SFX due to its size
[ ] mouse control to fire
[ ] add/sub time per fire

[ ] (maybe) particle system

or

([ ]) title screen + grab bag of other mods
